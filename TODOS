BUILD SYSTEMS

*) i686 builds should build their own versions of zlib and not rely on the checked in version...
*) Use android toolchains instead of not android ndk make. It will make it significally easier to deploy libraries.
*) Use standard install paths. It will ease deploying libraries build with other build systems.
*) ...

DONE:
*) Make it possible to easily clean a single target, rm -r out/target is a disaster waiting to happen...
